# Implementing Static and Dynamic Routing in Cisco Packet Tracer

## Description
This project involves setting up a network with three subnets (Network A, B, and C) using Cisco Packet Tracer. Network A and Network B are connected via static routing, while Network A and Network B are connected to Network C using a dynamic routing protocol. The aim is to ensure full connectivity between all PCs in the network.

## Introduction
In this project, we will configure both static and dynamic routing in a network to ensure that all PCs can communicate with each other. Static routing will be used between Network A and Network B, while a dynamic routing protocol will be employed between Network A, B, and C.

## Network Topology
Below is the network topology used for this project:
