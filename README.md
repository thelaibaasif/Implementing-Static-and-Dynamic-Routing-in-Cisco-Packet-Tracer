# Implementing-Static-and-Dynamic-Routing-in-Cisco-Packet-Tracer
This project demonstrates the implementation of both static and dynamic routing in a network using Cisco Packet Tracer. Network A and Network B are connected through static routing, while both Network A and Network B are connected to Network C through a dynamic routing protocol, ensuring full connectivity among all PCs.
